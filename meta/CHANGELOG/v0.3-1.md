## :rocket: Improvements

- **OpenMP Support (PR https://github.com/serkor1/SLmetrics/pull/40):**
  {SLmetrics} now supports parallelization through OpenMP. The OpenMP
  can be utilized as follows:

``` r
# 1) probability distribution
# generator
rand.sum <- function(n){
    x <- sort(runif(n-1))
    c(x,1) - c(0,x)
  }

# 2) generate probability
# matrix
set.seed(1903)
pk <- t(replicate(100,rand.sum(1e3)))

# 3) Enable OpenMP
SLmetrics::setUseOpenMP(TRUE)
#> OpenMP usage set to: enabled
system.time(SLmetrics::entropy(pk))
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.048   0.000   0.003

# 3) Disable OpenMP
SLmetrics::setUseOpenMP(FALSE)
#> OpenMP usage set to: disabled
system.time(SLmetrics::entropy(pk))
#>    user  system elapsed 
#>   0.001   0.000   0.001
```

- **Entropy with soft labels
  (https://github.com/serkor1/SLmetrics/issues/37):** `entropy()`,
  `cross.entropy()` and `relative.entropy()` have been introduced. These
  functions are heavily inspired by {scipy}. The functions can be used
  as follows:

``` r
# 1) Define actual
# and observed probabilities

# 1.1) actual probabilies
pk <- matrix(
  cbind(1/2, 1/2),
  ncol = 2
)

# 1.2) observed (estimated) probabilites
qk <- matrix(
  cbind(9/10, 1/10), 
  ncol = 2
)

# 2) calculate
# Entropy
cat(
  "Entropy", SLmetrics::entropy(
    pk
  ),
  "Relative Entropy", SLmetrics::relative.entropy(
    pk,
    qk
  ),
  "Cross Entropy", SLmetrics::cross.entropy(
    pk,
    qk
  ),
  sep = "\n"
)
#> Entropy
#> 0.6931472
#> Relative Entropy
#> 0.5108256
#> Cross Entropy
#> 1.203973
```

## :warning: Breaking changes

- **logloss:** The argument `response` have ben renamed to `qk` as in
  the `entropy()`-family to maintain some degree of consistency.
- **entropy.factor():** The function have been deleted and is no more.
  This was mainly due to avoid the documentation from being too large.
  The `logloss()`-function replaces it.

## :bug: Bug-fixes

- **Plot-method in ROC and prROC
  (https://github.com/serkor1/SLmetrics/issues/36):** Fixed a bug in
  `plot.ROC()` and `plot.prROC()` where if `panels = FALSE` additional
  lines would be added to the plot.
