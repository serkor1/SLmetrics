## :sparkles: Improvements

### New features

- **Relative Root Mean Squared Error:** The function normalizes the Root
  Mean Squared Error by a factor. There is no official way of
  normalizing it - and in {SLmetrics} the RMSE can be normalized using
  three options; mean-, range- and IQR-normalization. It can be used as
  follows,

``` r
## 1) define actual and
## predicted values
actual <- rnorm(50)
predicted <- actual + rnorm(50)

## 2) calculate rrse
## with normalization
## 0: mean
## 1: range
## 2: iqr
cat(
  "Mean Relative Root Mean Squared Error", SLmetrics::rrmse(
    actual        = actual,
    predicted     = predicted,
    normalization = 0
  ),
  "Range Relative Root Mean Squared Error", SLmetrics::rrmse(
    actual        = actual,
    predicted     = predicted,
    normalization = 1
  ),
  "IQR Relative Root Mean Squared Error", SLmetrics::rrmse(
    actual        = actual,
    predicted     = predicted,
    normalization = 2
  ),
  sep = "\n"
)
#> Mean Relative Root Mean Squared Error
#> 8.784975
#> Range Relative Root Mean Squared Error
#> 0.1951562
#> IQR Relative Root Mean Squared Error
#> 0.5694271
```

- **Log Loss:** Weighted and unweighted Log Loss, with and without
  normalization. The function can be used as follows,

``` r
## 1) define actual
## values and estimated
## probabilities
actual   <- factor(c("Class A", "Class B", "Class A"))
weights  <- c(0.3,0.9,1) 
response <- matrix(cbind(
    0.2, 0.8,
    0.8, 0.2,
    0.7, 0.3
),nrow = 3, ncol = 2)

## 2) weighted and unweighted
## log-loss
cat(
    "Unweighted Log Loss:",
    SLmetrics::logloss(
        actual,
        response
    ),
    "Weighted log Loss:",
    SLmetrics::weighted.logloss(
        actual,
        response,       
        weights
    ),
    sep = "\n"
)
#> Unweighted Log Loss:
#> 0.7297521
#> Weighted log Loss:
#> 0.4668102
```

- **Weighted Receiver Operator Characteristics:** `weighted.ROC()`, the
  function calculates the weighted True Positive and False Positive
  Rates for each threshold.

- **Weighted Precision-Recall Curve:** `weighted.prROC()`, the function
  calculates the weighted Recall and Precision for each threshold.

## :bug: Bug-fixes

- **Return named vectors:** The classification metrics when
  `micro == NULL` were not returning named vectors. This has been fixed.

## :boom: Breaking Changes

- **Weighted Confusion Matrix:** The `w`-argument in `cmatrix()` has
  been removed in favor of the more verbose weighted confusion matrix
  call `weighted.cmatrix()`-function. See below,

Prior to version `0.3-0` the weighted confusion matrix were a part of
the `cmatrix()`-function and were called as follows,

``` r
SLmetrics::cmatrix(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted,
    w         = weights
)
```

This solution, although simple, were inconsistent with the remaining
implementation of weighted metrics in {SLmetrics}. To regain consistency
and simplicity the weighted confusion matrix are now retrieved as
follows,

``` r
## 1) define actual
## and predicted values
## with sample weights
actual    <- factor(sample(letters[1:3], 50, replace = TRUE))
predicted <- factor(sample(letters[1:3], 50, replace = TRUE))
weights   <- runif(length(actual))

## 2) unweighted confusion
## matrix
SLmetrics::cmatrix(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted
)
#>   a b c
#> a 5 8 4
#> b 5 7 2
#> c 9 6 4

## 3) weighted confusion
## matrix
SLmetrics::weighted.cmatrix(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted,
    w         = weights
)
#>          a        b        c
#> a 2.322289 2.454870 1.638391
#> b 2.766585 4.259595 0.550205
#> c 3.620850 3.732882 2.151884
```
