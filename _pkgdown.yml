- title: Low-level supervised learning performance metrics
  desc: |
    The low-level functions are designed with speed and efficiency in mind and therefore have no defensive measures against user-error. If, for example, the passed
    vectors contains missing values, your `R`-session will crash without any informative error-message.

    > **Note:** All other possible error-sources like, for example, invalid divisions are handled internally by `c++` and `Rcpp`.

- subtitle: Regression Metrics
  desc: >
    The collection of low-level evaluation metrics for supervised regression problems. All functions are grouped
    together in simple and weighted means.

- subtitle: Classification Metrics
  desc: >
    The collection of low-level evaluation metrics for supervised classification problems. All functions are grouped by
    aliases and alternative terminology; the `recall()`- and `sensitivity()`-function calculates the same metric, for example.
