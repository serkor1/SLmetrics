## :sparkles: Improvements

- **Regression metrics (See PR
  https://github.com/serkor1/SLmetrics/pull/64):** All regression
  metrics have had their back-end optimized and are now 2-10 times
  faster than prior versions.
- **LAPACK/BLAS Support
  (https://github.com/serkor1/SLmetrics/pull/65):** Added LAPACK/BLAS
  support for efficient matrix-operations.
- **OpenMP:** Enabling/disabling OpenMP is now handled on the `R`-side
  and obeys `suppressMessages()`. See below:

``` r
## suppress OpenMP messages
suppressMessages(
  SLmetrics::openmp.off()
)
```

### :rocket: New features

- **Available threads:** The available number of threads can be
  retrieved using the `openmp.threads()`. See below:

``` r
## number of available
## threads
SLmetrics::openmp.threads()
#> [1] 24
```

## :bug: Bug-fixes

- **Diagnostic Odds Ratio:** The `dor()` is now returning a single
  `<[numeric]>`-value instead of `k` number of identical
  `<[numeric]>`-values.

## :boom: Breaking Changes

- **OpenMP Interface:** The interface to enabling/disabling OpenMP
  support has been reworked and has a more natural flow. The new
  interface is described below:

``` r
## enable OpenMP
SLmetrics::openmp.on()
#> OpenMP enabled!
```

``` r
## disable OpenMP
SLmetrics::openmp.off()
#> OpenMP disabled!
```

To set the number of threads use the `openmp.threads()` as follows:

``` r
## set number of threads
SLmetrics::openmp.threads(3)
#> Using 3 threads.
```
