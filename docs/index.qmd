# Preface {.unnumbered}

{SLmetrics} started as a personal project to learn C++, and was never *really* meant to be published nor, infact, named {SLmetrics}. But as time went by, and the committed time and commits grew the name stayed, and the goal to publish a functioning data science R package seemed like the natural next step.

The primary goal of {SLmetrics} is to be a *fast*, *memory efficient* and *reliable* low-level successor to {MLmetrics}; and the current benchmarks in @sec-benchmarking suggets that this goal, in fact, have been achieved.
