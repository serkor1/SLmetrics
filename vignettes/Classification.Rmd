In this vignette a brief overview of classification metrics in [{SLmetrics}](https://github.com/serkor1/SLmetrics) will be provided. The classification interface is broadly divided into two methods: `foo.cmatrix()` and `foo.factor()`. The former calculates the classification from a confusion matrix, while the latter calculates the same metric from two vectors: a vector of `actual` values and a vector of `predicted` values. Both are vectors of [factor] values. 

Throughout this vignette, the following data will be used:

```{r}
# 1) seed
set.seed(1903)

# 2) actual values
actual <- factor(
    x = sample(c("A", "B", "C"), size = 10, replace = TRUE)
)

# 3) predicted values
predicted <- factor(
    x = sample(c("A", "B", "C"), size = 10, replace = TRUE)
)

# 4) sample weights
weights <- runif(
    n = length(actual)
)
```

Assume that the `predicted` values are from a trained machine learning model. This vignette introduces a subset of the metrics available in [{SLmetrics}](https://github.com/serkor1/SLmetrics); see the [online documentation](https://serkor1.github.io/SLmetrics/) for more details and metrics.

## Computing classification metrics

The accuracy of the model can be evaluated using the `accuracy()`-function as follows:

```{r}
# 1) calculate accuracy
accuracy(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted
)
```

Many classification metrics have different names yet compute the same underlying value. For example, `recall` is also known as the `true positive rate` or `sensitivity`. These metrics can be calculated as follows:

```{r}
# 1) calculate recall
recall(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted
)

# 2) calculate sensitivity
sensitivity(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted
)

# 1) calculate true positive rate
tpr(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted
)
```

By default, all classification functions calculates the class-wise performance metrics where possible. The performance metrics can also be aggregated in `micro` and `macro` averages by using the `micro`-parameter:

```{r}
# 1) macro average
recall(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted,
    micro     = FALSE 
)

# 2) micro average
recall(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted,
    micro     = TRUE
)
```

Calculating multiple performance metrics using separate calls to `foo.factor()` can be inefficient because each function reconstructs the underlying confusion matrix. A more efficient approach is to construct the confusion matrix once and then pass it to your chosen metric function. To do this, you can use the `cmatrix()` function:

```{r}
# 1) confusion matrix
confusion_matrix <- cmatrix(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted
)

# 2) summarise confusion matrix
summary(
    confusion_matrix
)
```

Now you can pass the confusion matrix directly into the metric functions:

```{r}
# 1) calculate accuracy
accuracy(
    confusion_matrix
)

# 2) calculate false positive rate
fpr(
    confusion_matrix
)
```

## Computing weighted classification metrics

The weighted classification metrics can be calculated by using the `weighted.foo`-method which have a similar interface as the unweighted versions above. Below is an example showing how to compute a weighted version of `recall`:

```{r}
# 1) calculate recall
weighted.recall(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted,
    w         = weights
)

# 2) calculate sensitivity
weighted.sensitivity(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted,
    w         = weights
)

# 1) calculate true positive rate
weighted.tpr(
    actual    = actual,
    predicted = predicted,
    w         = weights
)
```

A small disclaimer applies to weighted metrics: it is **not** possible to pass a weighted confusion matrix directly into a `weighted.foo()` method. Consider the following example:

```{r}
# 1) calculate weighted confusion matrix
weighted_confusion_matrix <- weighted.cmatrix(
    actual = actual,
    predicted = predicted,
    w = weights
)

# 2) calculate weighted accuracy
try(
    weighted.accuracy(weighted_confusion_matrix)
)
```

This approach throws an error. Instead, pass the weighted confusion matrix into the unweighted function that uses a confusion matrix interface (i.e., `foo.cmatrix()`). For example:

```{r}
accuracy(weighted_confusion_matrix)
```

This returns the same weighted `accuracy` as if it were calculated directly:

```{r}
all.equal(
    accuracy(weighted_confusion_matrix),
    weighted.accuracy(actual, predicted, w = weights)
)
```
