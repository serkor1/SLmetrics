\description{
This dataset contains information used to estimate obesity levels in individuals from Mexico, Peru, and Colombia, based on their eating habits and physical conditions. It comprises 2,111 records with 17 attributes, including demographic information, lifestyle habits, and obesity levels.
}
\details{
The dataset was collected to analyze the relationship between eating habits, physical conditions, and obesity levels. It includes both synthetically generated data (77\%) using the Weka tool and the SMOTE filter, and real data (23\%) collected directly from users through a web platform. The target variable, \code{class}, categorizes individuals into various obesity levels.
